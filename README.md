# HTML-CSS-Git-Challenge-Code-Refactor
Horiseon Solution Services is a digital marketing agency that specializes in Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. HSS strives to drive quality leads at scale, while remaining efficient and cost-effective. 

For this project, I was tasked with delivering a codebase that follows accessibility standards with the intention of optimizing their website for SEO. I focused on both efficient HTML by cleaning up the use of div, as well as descriptive and streamlined CSS to ensure effective and efficient styling. Ensured that the usability of the website was optimal by linking the options at the top of the page to their respective sections. See example of finished product below:
